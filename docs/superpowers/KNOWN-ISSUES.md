## Leave-workspace: self-leave rule staged but not deployed

**Status:** Update (2026-07-29) — the deploy this entry was blocked on has now happened.
`Gateway.mode` flipped to `"gateway"` (commit `649046d`), and Taher confirms Cloud Functions +
`firestore.rules` are deployed and working. Since `firestore.rules` ships as one unit, the
self-leave clause described below should now be live for free. **Not independently re-verified
in a session** (i.e. nobody has confirmed the leaver's member doc actually gets auto-removed
post-deploy) — treat as likely-resolved, not confirmed-resolved, until someone checks it on
live data.

**Original issue (2026-06-12), kept for context:** Re-login bug was fixed in code from the start
(`leaveCurrentTenant()` clears the tenant pointer on the leaver's own `users/{uid}` doc — a
self-write allowed even under the old rules). What was blocked on this deploy specifically: a
`firestore.rules` clause letting a member delete their OWN non-owner membership
(`tenants/{tid}/members/{uid}` where `uid == request.auth.uid`); before this deploy, that
self-delete was denied (403) and the leaver's member doc lingered as `status: active` (cosmetic
only — the owner could always remove the ghost member manually via Member Management).

## Order returns: cross-period temporal netting mismatch

When a completed order is returned/modified in a *different month* than the original sale, the
Analysis reports net the reversal in **different periods** depending on the surface:

- **Sold / Profit** are ledger-sourced (`TransactionStore` sale + return events). A return event is
  dated when the return happens, so Sold/Profit reduce the **return-month** bucket.
- **Revenue** is order-sourced (`OrdersStore.orders`, bucketed by `order.date`). `applyAdjustment`
  updates the order's lines/total but not `order.date`, so Revenue reduces the **original-sale-month**
  bucket retroactively.

Net effect for a sale in month A returned in month B: month A's Revenue drops while its Sold/Profit
stay full; month B shows the Sold/Profit reversal with no Revenue change. The "this year" hero and
all-time totals reconcile correctly; only narrower period buckets (and period-scoped exports) show
the split.

**Decision:** Accepted limitation for now (chosen during the returns/exchange brainstorm — the
"preserve consumption[] on adjusted lines" fix closed the by-supplier ₹0 bug; the temporal split was
explicitly logged here rather than re-sourcing Revenue from the ledger). Revisit when Revenue moves
to a ledger-sourced read (natural fit with the P0 immutable-ledger roadmap), at which point all three
surfaces would net in the same period.
